<p><h4>Overview:</h4>
<p>The 'diagnose -p' command is used to display 'at a glance'
information about the job priority configuration and its effects on the
current idle jobs. The information presented by this command includes
priority weights, priority components, and the percentage contribution
of each component to the total job priority.
<p>The command hides information about priority components
which have been deactivated (ie, by setting the corresponding component
priority weight to 0). For each displayed priority component, this
command gives a small amount of context sensitive information. The
following table documents this information. In all cases, the output
is of the form &lt;PERCENT>(&lt;CONTEXT INFO) where &lt;PERCENT> is the
percentage contribution of the associated priority component to the job's
total priority.

<p> Note that the above output is fairly lengthy.
You may need to widen your browser to properly read it. (Likewise,
you may need to expand your terminal to read the actual command output!)
As mentioned previously, the 'diagnose -p' command only displays information
for priority components actually utilized. In the above example,
QOS, Fairshare, QueueTime, ExpansionFactor, and Resource components are
all utilized in determining a job's priority. Other components, such
as Service Targets, and Bypass are not used and thus are not displayed.
(See the '<a href="../mauiadmin.html#jobprioritization">Priority Overview</a>'
for more information) The output consists of a header, a job by job
analysis of idle jobs, and a summary section.
<p> The header provides column labeling and provides configured
priority component and subcomponent weights. In the above example,
QOSWEIGHT is set to 1000 and FSWEIGHT is set to 100. When configuring
fairshare, a site also has the option of weighting the individual components
of a job's overall fairshare, including its user, group, and account fairshare
components. In this output, the user, group, and account fairshare
weights are set to 5, 1, and 1 respectively.
<p> The job by job analysis displays a job's total priority
and the percentage contribution to that priority of each of the priority
components. In this example, job 'fr8n01.1260.0' has a total priority
of 1814. Neither QOS nor Fairshare contribute to any of the job's
in the queue because there is not a QOS priority set for QOS 0, 1, or 5.
Also, no fairshare targets are set for any of the users, groups, or accounts
associated with any of the jobs currently idle. Things finally get
interesting when we get to the queue time component column. Job 'fr8n01.1260.0'
has only been queued for 0.1 hours, contributing a total of 0.58% of its
total priority (ie, 0.0058 * 1814 = ~10 priority points). The Expansion
Factor component is much more significant, contributing 55.32% of this
job's total priority or .5532 * 1814 = ~1004 priority points. (Note
the priority weights of 2 for Queuetime and 1000 for XFactor affecting
the relative contributions of each of these components) The final
priority component, 'Resource', only has one active subcomponent, processors
(Note that nodes, PEs, and memory are deactivated by zero priority subcomponent
weights). For the job we are analyzing, the resource component contributes
44.1% of the job's total priority or .4410 * 1814 = ~800 priority points.
As expects, the percentages sum to 100 and the corresponding priority points
sum to 1814.
<p> At the end of the job by job description, a 'Totals'
line is displayed which documents the average percentage contributions
of each priority component to the current idle jobs. In this example,
the queuetime, xfactor, and resource components contributed an average
of 0.04%, 11.57%, and 88.39% to the idle jobs' total priorities.
