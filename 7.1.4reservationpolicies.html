          <h1>7.1.4 Reservation Policies</h1>

          <p>In addition to standing and administrative reservations, Maui can also create <i>priority</i> reservations. These reservations are used to allow the benefits of out-of-order execution (such as is available with <a href="8.2backfill.html">backfill</a>) without the side effect of job starvation. Starvation can occur in any system where the potential exists for a job to be overlooked by the scheduler for an indefinite period. In the case of backfill, small jobs may continue to be run on available resources as they become available while a large job sits in the queue never able to find enough nodes available simultaneously to run on. To avoid such situations, priority reservations are created for high priority jobs which cannot run immediately. When making these reservations, the scheduler determines the earliest time the job could start, and then reserves these resources for use by this job at that future time.</p>

          <p>By default, only the highest priority job will receive a priority reservation. However, this behavior is configurable via the <a href="a.fparameters.html#reservationdepth">RESERVATIONDEPTH</a> policy. Maui's default behavior of only reserving the highest priority job allows backfill to be used in a form known as <i>liberal</i> backfill. This liberal backfill tends to maximize system utilization and minimize overall average job turnaround time. However, it does lead to the potential of some lower priority jobs being indirectly delayed and may lead to greater variance in job turnaround time. The <b>RESERVATIONDEPTH</b> parameter can be set to a very large value, essentially enabling what is called <i>conservative</i> backfill where every job which cannot run is given a reservation. Most sites prefer the liberal backfill approach associated with the default <b>RESERVATIONDEPTH</b> of 1 or select a slightly higher value. It is important to note that to prevent starvation in conjunction with reservations, monotonically increasing priority factors such as queuetime or job xfactor should be enabled. See the <a href="11.2jobpriority.html">Prioritization Overview</a> for more information on priority factors.</p>

          <p>Another important consequence of backfill and reservation depth is its affect on job priority. In Maui, all jobs are prioritized. Backfill allows jobs to be run out of order and thus, to some extent, job priority to be ignored. This effect, known as 'priority dilution' can cause many site policies implemented via Maui prioritization policies to be ineffective. Setting the <b>RESERVATIONDEPTH</b> parameter to a higher value will give job priority 'more teeth' at the cost of slightly lower system utilization. This lower utilization results from the constraints of these additional reservations, decreasing the scheduler's freedom and its ability to find additional optimizing schedules. Anecdotal evidence indicates that these utilization losses are fairly minor, rarely exceeding 8%.</p>

          <p>In addition to <b>RESERVATIONDEPTH</b>, sites also have the ability to control how reservations are maintained. Maui's dynamic job prioritization allows sites to prioritize jobs so that their priority order can change over time. It is possible that one job can be at the top of the priority queue for a time, and then get bypassed by another job submitted later. The parameter <a href="a.fparameters.html#reservationpolicy">RESERVATIONPOLICY</a> allows a site to determine what how existing reservations should be handled when new reservations are made. The value <b>HIGHEST</b> will cause that all jobs which have ever received a priority reservation will maintain that reservation until they run even if other jobs later bypass them in priority value. The value <b>CURRENTHIGHEST</b> will cause that only the current top &lt;RESERVATIONDEPTH&gt; priority jobs will receive reservations. If a job had a reservation but has been bypassed in priority by another job so that it no longer qualifies as being amongst the top &lt;RESERVATIONDEPTH&gt; jobs, it will lose its reservation. Finally, the value <b>NEVER</b> indicates that no priority reservations will be made.</p>

          <p>QOS based reservation depths can be enabled via the <a href="a.fparameters.html#reservationqoslist">RESERVATIONQOSLIST</a> parameter. This parameter allows varying reservation depths to be associated with different sets of job QoS's. For example, the following configuration will create two reservation depth <i>groupings</i>:</p>

          <p>----<br>
          <tt>RESERVATIONDEPTH[0] 8</tt><br>
          <tt>RESERVATIONQOSLIST[0] highprio interactive debug</tt></p>

          <p><tt>RESERVATIONDEPTH[1] 2</tt><br>
          <tt>RESERVATIONQOSLIST[1] batch</tt><br>
          ----</p>

          <p>This example will cause that the top 8 jobs belonging to the aggregate group of <tt>highprio</tt>, <tt>interactive</tt>, and <tt>debug</tt> QoS jobs will receive priority reservations. Additionally, the top 2 <tt>batch</tt> QoS jobs will also receive priority reservations. Use of this feature allows sites to maintain high throughput for important jobs by guaranteeing the a significant proportion of these jobs are making progress towards starting through use of the priority reservation.</p>

          <p>A final reservation policy is in place to handle a number of real-world issues. Occasionally when a reservation becomes active and a job attempts to start, various resource manager race conditions or corrupt state situations will prevent the job from starting. By default, Maui assumes the resource manager is corrupt, releases the reservation, and attempts to re-create the reservation after a short timeout. However, in the interval between the reservation release and the re-creation timeout, other priority reservations may allocate the newly available resources, reserving them before the original reservation gets an opportunity to reallocate them. Thus, when the original job reservation is re-established, its original resource may be unavailable and the resulting new reservation may be delayed several hours from the earlier start time. The parameter <a href="a.fparameters.html#reservationretrytime">RESERVATIONRETYTIME</a> allows a site that is experiencing frequent resource manager race conditions and/or corruption situations to tell Maui to hold on to the reserved resource for a period of time in an attempt to allow the resource manager to correct its state.</p>
