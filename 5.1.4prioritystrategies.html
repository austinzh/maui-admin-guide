          <h1>5.1.4 Prioritization Strategies</h1>

          <p>Each component or subcomponent may be used to accomplish different objectives. <b>WALLTIME</b> can be used to favor (or disfavor) jobs based on their duration. Likewise, <b>ACCOUNT</b> can be used to favor jobs associated with a particular project while <b>QUEUETIME</b> can be used to favor those jobs which have been waiting the longest.</p>

          <p><b>- <a href="5.1.2priorityfactors.html#queuetimesubcomponent">Queue Time</a></b><br>

          <p>Each priority factor group may contain one or more subfactors. For example, the Resource factor consists of Node, Processor, Memory, Swap, Disk, and PE components. Figure &lt;X&gt; shows the current priority breakdown. From the figure, it is quickly apparent that the prioritization problem is fairly 'nasty' due to the fact that every site needs to prioritize a bit differently. Fortunately, there has not yet been a site that has desired to use more than a fraction of these priority factors, thus greatly simplifying the job priority tuning issue. When calculating a priority, the various priority factors are summed and then bounded between 0 and MAX_PRIO_VAL which is currently defined as 100000000 (one billion).</p>

          <p>Each priority factor is reviewed in detail below. The command '<a href="commands/diagnosepriority.html">diagnose -p</a>' is designed to assist in visualizing the priority distribution resulting from the current job priority configuration. Also, the <a href="commands/showgrid.html">showgrid</a> command will help indicate the impact of the current priority settings on scheduler service distributions.</p>
