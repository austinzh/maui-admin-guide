<h1>A.3&nbsp; Case Study: Background Load</h1>

<big><p><b>Overview</b></p></big>
<p>
A 64 proc Altix system needs to be scheduled with a significant 'background' load.

</table>

<big><p><b>Goals</b></p></big>
<p>
The scheduler must run the machine at maximum capacity without overcommitting
either memory or processors.&nbsp; A significant, variable background load exists
from jobs submitted outside of the resource manager's view or control.&nbsp;
The scheduler must track and account for this load and allow space for some
variability and growth of this load over time.&nbsp; The scheduler should also
kill any job which violates its requested resource allocation and notify the
associated user of this violation.
</p>
<p>
The scheduler should maximize the throughput associated with the queued jobs
while avoiding starvation as a secondary concern.&nbsp;
</p>

<big><p><b>Analysis</b></p></big>
<p>
The background load causes many problems in any mixed batch/interactive
environment.&nbsp; One problem is that a situation may arise in which the
highest priority batch job cannot run.&nbsp; Moab can make a reservation for
this highest priority job.&nbsp; But because there are no constraints on the
background load, Moab cannot determine when it will drop enough to allow this
job to run.&nbsp; By default, it optimistically attempts a reservation for the
next scheduling iteration, perhaps 1 minute out.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The problem is that this reservation now exists one minute out and when Moab
attempts to backfill, it can only consider jobs which request less than one
minute or which can fit "beside" this high priority job.&nbsp; During the next
iteration, Moab still cannot run the job because the background load has not
dropped and again creates a new reservation for one minute into the future.&nbsp;
<p>
The background load has basically turned batch scheduling into an exercise in
"resource scavenging."&nbsp; If the priority job reservation was not there,
other smaller queued jobs might be able to run.&nbsp; Therefore, to maximize
the "scavenging" effect, the scheduler should be configured to allow this high
priority job the first opportunity to use available resources but prevent it
from reserving these resources if it cannot run immediately.&nbsp;
</p>

<big><p><b>Configuration</b></p></big>
<p>
The configuration needs to accomplish several main objectives including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>track the background load to prevent oversubscription</li>
<li>favor small, short jobs to maximize job turnaround</li>
<li>prevent blocked high priority jobs from creating reservations</li>
<li>work with an allocation manager to charge for utilized CPU time</li>
<li>cancel jobs which exceed specified resource limits</li>
<li>notify users when a job is canceled due to resource usage limit violations</li>
</ul>

<big>
<p><b>Monitoring</b></p></big>
<p>
The most difficult aspects of this environment are properly reserving space for
the untracked background load.&nbsp; Since this load is outside the control of
the scheduler and resource manager, it has no constraints.&nbsp; It could grow
suddenly and overwhelm the machine, or just as easily disappear.&nbsp; The
NODEUNTRACKEDLOADFACTOR parameter provides slack for this background load to
grow and shrink.&nbsp; However, since there is no control over the load, the
effectiveness of this parameter will depend on the statistical behavior of the
load.&nbsp; The greater the value, the more slack provided, and the less likely
the system is to be overcommitted.&nbsp; However, a larger value also means
more resources are in this reserve which are not available for scheduling.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The second aspect of this environment which must be monitored is the trade-off
between high job throughput and job starvation.&nbsp; The 'locally greedy'
approach of favoring the smallest, shortest jobs will have a negative effect on
larger and longer jobs.&nbsp; The large, long jobs which have been queued for
some time can be pushed to the front of the queue by increasing the
<a href="../a.fparameters.html#queuetimeweight">QUEUETIMEWEIGHT</a> factor
until a satisfactory balance is achieved.&nbsp;

<big><p><b>Conclusions</b></p></big>
<p>
The right solution is to migrate the users over to the batch system or provide
them with a constrained resource 'box' to play in, either through a processor
partition, standing reservation, or a logical software system.&nbsp; The value
in this is that it prevents this unpredictable background load from wreaking
havoc with a dedicated resource reservation system.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Moab can reserve resources for jobs according to all currently available
information.&nbsp; However, the unpredictable nature of the background load
means that those resources may not be available when they should be, which
result in canceled reservations and hinder enforcement of site policies and
priorities.&nbsp;
