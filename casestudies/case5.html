<h1>A.5&nbsp; Case Study: Multi-Queue Cluster with QOS and Charge Rates</h1>

<big><p><b>Overview</b></p></big>
<p>
A 160 node, single processor Linux&#0174; cluster is to be used to support various
organizations within an enterprise.&nbsp; The system should allow a user to
request improved job turnaround time in exchange for a higher charge rate.&nbsp;
A portion of the system must be reserved for small development jobs at all
times.&nbsp;

<big><p><b>Goals</b></p></big>
<p>
Management desires the following queue structure:
</p>

</pre>

<p>
For charging, management has decided to charge by job walltime since the nodes
will not be shared.&nbsp; Management has also dictated that 16 of the single
processor nodes should be dedicated to running small jobs requiring 16 or fewer
nodes.&nbsp; Management has also decided that it would like to allow only serial
jobs to run on the large memory nodes and would like to charge these jobs at a
rate of 4x.&nbsp; There are no constraints on the remaining nodes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
This site has goals which are focused more on a supplying a straightforward
queue environment to the end users than on maximizing the scheduling
performance of the system.&nbsp; The Moab configuration has the primary purpose
of faithfully reproducing the queue constraints above while maintaining
reasonable scheduling performance in the process.&nbsp;
</p>

<big><p><b>Analysis</b></p></big>
<p>
Since we are using PBS as the resource manager, this should be a pretty
straightforward process.&nbsp; It will involve setting up an allocations
manager to handle charging, configuring queue priorities, and creating a system
reservation to manage the 16 processors dedicated to small jobs, and another
for managing the large memory nodes.&nbsp;
</p>

<big><p><b>Configuration</b></p></big>
<p>
First, the queue structure must be configured.&nbsp; The best place to handle
this is via the PBS configuration.&nbsp; The <tt>qmgr</tt> command can be used
to set up the nine queues described above.&nbsp; PBS supports the node and
walltime constraints as well as the queue priorities.&nbsp; Moab will honor
queue priorities configured within PBS.&nbsp; Alternatively, these priorities
can be specified directly within the Moab <tt>fs.cfg</tt> file for resource
managers which do not support this capability.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
We will be using QBank to handle all allocations and so, will want to configure
the the "per class charge rates" there.&nbsp; Note that QBank 2.9 or higher is
required for per class charge rate support.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Now, two reservations are needed.&nbsp; The first reservation will be for the
16 small memory nodes.&nbsp; It should only allow node access to jobs requesting
up to 16 processors.&nbsp; In this environment, this is probably most easily
accomplished with a reservation class ACL containing the queues which allow
1 - 16 node jobs.&nbsp;
</p>

<big><p><b>Monitoring</b></p></big>
<p>
The commands <a href="../commands/mdiag.html">mdiag -s</a> and
<a href="../commands/mdiag-reservations.html">mdiag -r</a> can be used to
examine the standing reservations and all reservations in more detail.&nbsp;
The <a href="../commands/mdiag-class.html">mdiag -c</a> command can be used
to examine and verify class/queue information.&nbsp; The
<a href="../commands/mshow.html">mshow</a> command may also be used to display
information about a class/queue, job, and reservation.&nbsp;
</p>

<big><p><b>Conclusions:</b></p></big>
<p>
Moab supports intelligent scheduling across a wide variety of existing queue
types.&nbsp; This intelligence allows administrators to charge for access to
priority resources in a very flexible manner.&nbsp; Moab will work seamlessly
with other software products to implement the desired behavior.&nbsp;
