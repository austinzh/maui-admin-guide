<h1>A.1&nbsp; Case Study: Mixed Parallel/Serial Homogeneous Cluster</h1>

<big><p><b>Overview</b></p></big>
<p>
A multi-user site wishes to control the distribution of compute cycles while
minimizing job turnaround time and maximizing overall system utilization.&nbsp;
</p>

<big><p><b>Resources</b></p></big>

<table class="navTable" width=100%>

      with their work until a job they have submitted completes.&nbsp; Many of
      these jobs are interactive in nature.&nbsp; Throughout the day, large,
      longer running production workload is also submitted but these jobs do
      not have comparable turnaround time pressure.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<big><p><b>Goals</b></p></big>
<p>
The groups 'Meteorology' and 'Statistics' must receive approximately 45% and
35% of the total computing resources respectively.&nbsp; Nodes cannot be shared
among tasks from different jobs.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The system should attempt to minimize turnaround time during prime hours
(Mon - Fri, 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM) and maximize system utilization during all other
times.&nbsp; System maintenance should be scheduled efficiently within these
constraints.&nbsp;

<big><p><b>Analysis</b></p></big>
<p>The network topology is flat and nodes are homogeneous.&nbsp; This makes
life significantly simpler.&nbsp; The focus for this site is controlling
distribution of compute cycles without negatively impacting overall system
turnaround and utilization.&nbsp; Currently, the best mechanism for doing this
is <a href="../6.3fairshare.html">Fairshare</a>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Fairshare can be used to adjust the priority of jobs to favor or disfavor jobs
based on fairshare targets and historical usage.&nbsp; In essence, this feature
improves the turnaround time of the jobs not meeting their fairshare target at
the expense of those that are.&nbsp; Depending on the criticality of the
resource distribution constraints, an allocation bank such as <a href="http://www.adaptivecomputing.com/gold">Gold</a>,
which enables more stringent control over the amount of resources which
can be delivered to various users, may be desirable.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
To manage the prime time job turnaround constraints, a
<a href="../7.1.3standingreservations.html">standing reservation</a>
would probably be the best approach.&nbsp; A standing reservation can be used
to set aside a subset of the nodes for quick turnaround jobs.&nbsp; This
reservation can be configured with a time based access point to allow only
jobs which will complete within some time X to utilize these resources.&nbsp;
The reservation has advantages over a typical queue based solution in this case
in that these quick turnaround jobs can be run anywhere resources are
available, either inside, or outside the reservation, or even crossing
reservation boundaries.&nbsp; The site does not have any hard constraints about
what is acceptable turnaround time so the best approach would probably be to
analyze the site's workload under a number of configurations using the
<a href="../16.0simulations.html">simulator</a> and observe the
corresponding scheduling behavior.
</p>
<p>
For general optimization, there are a number of scheduling aspects to consider,
scheduling algorithm, reservation policies, node allocation policies, and job
prioritization.&nbsp; It is almost always a good idea to utilize the scheduler's
<a href="../8.2backfill.html">backfill</a> capability since this has a tendency
to increase average system utilization and decrease average turnaround time in a
surprisingly fair manner.&nbsp; It does tend to favor somewhat small and short
jobs over others which is exactly what this site desires.&nbsp; Reservation
policies are often best left alone unless rare starvation issues arise or
quality of service policies are desired.&nbsp; Node allocation policies are
effectively meaningless since the system is homogeneous.&nbsp; The final
scheduling aspect, job prioritization, can play a significant role in meeting
site goals.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
To maximize overall system utilization, maintaining a significant
<a href="../5.1.4prioritystrategies.html">Resource</a> priority factor will favor
large resource (processor) jobs, pushing them to the front of the queue.&nbsp;
Large jobs, though often only a small portion of a site's job count, regularly
account for the majority of a site's delivered compute cycles.&nbsp; To
minimize job turnaround, the <a href="../5.1.2priorityfactors.html">XFactor</a>
priority factor will favor short running jobs.&nbsp; Finally, in order for
fairshare to be effective, a significant <a href="../6.3fairshare.html">Fairshare</a>
priority factor must be included.&nbsp;
</p>

<big><p><b>Configuration</b></p></big>
<p>
For this scenario, a resource manager configuration consisting of a single,
global queue/class with no constraints would allow Moab the maximum flexibility
and opportunities for optimization.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The following Moab configuration would be a good initial stab:
</p>

<p><div class="example">

<pre>
# reserve 16 processors during prime time for jobs requiring less than 2 hours to complete
SRNAME[0]          fast
SRTASKCOUNT[0]     16
SRDAYS[0]          MON TUE WED THU FRI
SRSTARTTIME[0]     8:00:00
SRENDTIME[0]       17:00:00
SRMAXTIME[0]       2:00:00

# prioritize jobs for Fairshare, XFactor, and Resources
RESOURCEWEIGHT     20
XFACTORWEIGHT      100
FAIRSHAREWEIGHT    100

# disable SMP node sharing
NODEACCESSPOLICY   DEDICATED
</pre>
</div></p>

<p><div class="example">

<pre>
Group:Meteorology  FSTARGET=45
Group:Statistics   FSTARGET=35
</pre>
</div></p>

<big><p><b>Monitoring</b></p></big>

The <a href="../commands/mdiag-fairshare.html">mdiag -f</a> command will allow
you to monitor the effectiveness of the fairshare component of your job
prioritization.&nbsp; Adjusting the Fairshare priority factor will make
fairshare more or less effective.&nbsp; A trade off must occur between
fairshare and other goals managed via job prioritization.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
The <a href="../commands/mdiag-priority.html">mdiag -p</a> command will help you
analyze the priority distributions of the currently idle jobs.&nbsp; The
<a href="../commands/showstatsf.html">showstats -f AVGXFACTOR</a> command will
provide a good indication of average job turnaround while the
<a href="../commands/showstats.html">showstats</a> command will give an excellent
analysis of longer term historical performance statistics.&nbsp;
</p>

<big><p><b>Conclusions</b></p></big>

Any priority configuration will need to be tuned over time because the effect
of priority weights is highly dependent upon the site specific workload.&nbsp;
Additionally, the priority weights themselves are part of a feedback loop
which adjust the site workload.&nbsp; However, most sites quickly stabilize and
significant priority tuning is unnecessary after a few days.&nbsp;
