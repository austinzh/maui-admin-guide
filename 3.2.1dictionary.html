                Any object which can be utilized (i.e., consumed and thus made unavailable to another job) by, or dedicated to a job is considered to be a resource. Common examples of resources are a node's physical memory or local disk. As these resources may given to one job and thus unavailable to another, they are considered to be consumable. Other aspects of a node, such as its operating system, are not considered to be consumable since its use by one job does not preclude its use by another.

                <p>Note that some node objects, such as a network adapter, may be dedicated under some operating systems and resource managers and not under others. On systems where the network adapter cannot be dedicated and the network usage per job cannot be specified or tracked, network adapters are not considered to be resources, but rather attributes.</p>

                <p>Nodes possess a specific quantity of consumable resources such as real memory, local disk, or processors. In a resource management system, the node manager may choose to report only those configured resources available to batch jobs. For example, a node may possess a 80 GB hard drive but may have only 20 GB dedicated to batch jobs. Consequently, the resource manager may report that the node has 20 GB of local disk available when idle. Jobs may explicitly request a certain quantity of consumable resources</p>
