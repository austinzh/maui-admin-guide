          <h1>16.1 Simulation Overview</h1>

          <h2>16.1.1 Test Drive</h2>

          <p>If you want to see what the scheduler is capable of, the simulated test drive is probably your best bet. This allows you to safely play with arbitrary configurations and issue otherwise 'dangerous' commands without fear of losing your job! :) In order to run a simulation, you need a simulated machine (defined by a <a href="trace.html#resourcetrace">resource trace file</a>) and a simulated set of jobs (defined by a <a href="trace.html#workloadtrace">workload trace file</a>). Rather than discussing the advantages of this approach in gory detail up front, let's just get started and discuss things along the way.</p>

          <p><b>Issue the following commands:</b></p>

          <p><b>&gt; vi maui.cfg</b><br>
          <b>(change '<a href="a.fparameters.html#runmode">SERVERMODE</a> NORMAL' to 'SERVERMODE SIMULATION')</b><br>
          <b>(add '<a href="a.fparameters.html#simresourcetracefile">SIMRESOURCETRACEFILE</a> traces/Resource.Trace1')</b><br>
          <b>(add '<a href="a.fparameters.html#simworkloadtracefile">SIMWORKLOADTRACEFILE</a> traces/Workload.Trace1')</b><br>
          <b>(add '<a href="a.fparameters.html#simstopiteration">SIMSTOPITERATION</a> 1')</b></p>

          <p><b># the steps above specified that the scheduler should do the following:</b><br>
          <b># 1) Run in 'Simulation' mode rather than in 'Normal' or live mode.</b><br>
          <b># 2) Obtain information about the simulated compute resources in the</b><br>
          <b># file 'traces/Resource.Trace1'.</b><br>
          <b># 3) Obtain information about the jobs to be run in simulation in the</b><br>
          <b># file 'traces/Workload.Trace1'</b><br>
          <b># 4) Load the job and node info, start whatever jobs can be started on</b><br>
          <b># the nodes, and then wait for user commands. Do not advance</b><br>
          <b># simulated time until instructed to do so.</b></p>

          <p><b>&gt; maui &amp;</b></p>

          <p><b># give the scheduler a few seconds to warm up and then look at the</b><br>
          <b># list of jobs currently in the queue. (To obtain a full description</b><br>
          <b># of each of the commands used below, please see the command's man</b><br>

          <p><b>&gt; showq</b></p>

          <p><b># This command breaks the jobs in the queue into three groups, 'Active'</b><br>
          <b># jobs which are currently running, 'Idle' jobs which can run as soon</b><br>
          <b># as the required resources become available, and 'Non Queued' jobs</b><br>
          <b># which are currently ineligible to be run because they violate some</b><br>
          <b># configured policy.</b></p>

          <p><b># By default, the simulator initially submits 100 jobs from the</b><br>
          <b># workload trace file, 'Workload.Trace1'. Looking at the 'showq'</b><br>

          <b># 'Resource.Trace1'.</b></p>

          <p><b>&gt; showq -r</b></p>
